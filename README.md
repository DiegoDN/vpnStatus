# VPN status indicator
A simple utility that displays an indicator in the system tray regarding your VPN connection status.

You can find more details on [original repo](https://github.com/rvaccarim/vpnStatus) and on [original blog post](https://robertovaccari.com/blog/2021_02_24_vpn_status).

My take on this just customize the Icons (the original icons are very good, but I'm colorblind and have a hard time to differentiate between the used icons to show connected and disconnected states).

To build I've used Visual Studio 2019.
